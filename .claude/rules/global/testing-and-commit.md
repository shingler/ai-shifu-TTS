# Claude Rule: Testing And Commit

Use this Claude-only rule to route testing and commit hygiene without
duplicating the shared repository guidance already stored in `AGENTS.md`.

- Prefer the nearest `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` pair before reading any
  deeper path-specific rule in this folder.

- Before changing code, inspect the current implementation and reuse existing
  abstractions where possible instead of building a parallel solution from
  scratch.

- Keep the repository hard rules visible in the primary manual docs:
  English-only code-facing text, no hardcoded user-facing strings or secrets,
  and shared-contract doc updates in the same change.

- Use `docs/engineering-baseline.md` for the stable engineering handbook, and
  use the layered `AGENTS.md` files for AI execution rules.

- Before each commit, review the nearest `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files for
  the touched areas; if the implementation change makes them inaccurate,
  update those docs in the same commit.

- For complex design work, create an ExecPlan under
  `docs/exec-plans/active/` and maintain it according to `PLANS.md`.

- Keep the ExecPlan current as work progresses. Record progress, discoveries,
  and decisions in the plan instead of relying on chat-only context.

- Move completed ExecPlans to `docs/exec-plans/completed/` once
  implementation and verification are done.

- When Claude is asked for a commit-sized change, run the smallest relevant
  verification first and widen only when shared contracts are affected.

- Before running `git commit`, run `python scripts/check_dev_tools.py` to
  confirm lefthook and its underlying tools are installed. The lefthook hooks
  are silently skipped when lefthook is not installed, so if the doctor reports
  missing tools, surface the printed install commands to the user and pause the
  commit until they are installed or the user explicitly opts to proceed.

- Keep commit hygiene aligned with the shared repository rule set:
  Conventional Commit subjects, English-only code-facing text, and no skipped
  migration review after backend schema changes.

- If a task changes only docs or AI-instruction files, the minimum
  verification target is `python scripts/check_repo_harness.py`.
