# Per-boot reconciliation: bring up Redis and MySQL and wait until ready.
# Idempotent - safe to run when the services are already running.
#
# Note on the MySQL self-heal below: when this environment is booted from a
# prebuilt snapshot, the restored InnoDB data files can live on inodes whose
# O_DIRECT access fails on the overlay filesystem (mysqld aborts in InnoDB init
# with "Operating system error number 22" / "close returned OS error 122").
# Rewriting the datadir to fresh inodes with a plain copy resolves it without
# touching the data itself. The rewrite is transactional and guarded so it can
# never destroy the only datadir:
#   * it runs only when THIS start attempt logged the O_DIRECT error (the error
#     log is inspected from the offset captured just before starting mysqld, so
#     a historical entry cannot trigger a false heal);
#   * it runs only after mysqld is confirmed stopped (never copies live files);
#   * it stages a verified copy and keeps the original as a backup until the
#     fresh copy is swapped in, rolling back on any failure.
