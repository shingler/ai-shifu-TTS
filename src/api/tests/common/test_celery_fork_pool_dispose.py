"""Celery worker children must not reuse the parent's pooled connections.

The celery parent builds the Flask app (validating a DB connection on the
way); billiard then forks worker children which inherit the pool with the
parent's open sockets. Production journals showed one connection checked
out by pid=1 and then by two different worker pids on the same MySQL
server thread id - concurrent children interleaving one socket is the
off-by-one protocol desync. The worker_process_init hook must discard the
inherited pool without touching the parent's file descriptors.
