"""Unique scoped-session scope tokens across app contexts.

The stock Flask-SQLAlchemy scope function keys sessions on id(app_ctx) - a
recycled memory address. These tests pin the replacement's contract: a
stable token within one context, a NEW token for every context (so a later
context can never adopt a dead context's registry slot), and normal session
lifecycle via teardown.
