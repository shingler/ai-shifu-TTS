"""Unit-of-work transaction boundary for service code.

Historically service functions called ``db.session.commit()`` wherever they
pleased (213 call sites at the 2026-07 inventory), which hides transaction
boundaries and makes helpers commit state their callers cannot roll back.
``unit_of_work()`` makes the boundary explicit:

    from flaskr.dao import uow

    def create_order(...):
        with uow.unit_of_work():
            ...  # add/flush freely; NO commits inside
        # committed here, or fully rolled back on exception

Rules:

- The OUTERMOST ``unit_of_work()`` commits on clean exit and rolls back on
  exception. Nested ``unit_of_work()`` blocks join the outer transaction and
  do nothing on exit, so a helper can declare a boundary without breaking its
  caller's.
- Code inside a unit of work must not call ``db.session.commit()`` /
  ``rollback()`` directly; use ``db.session.flush()`` when generated ids are
  needed mid-flow.
- ``retry_on_deadlock`` composes with this: decorate the function that OWNS
  the outermost unit of work, so a MySQL deadlock (rolled back quietly by the
  decorator) re-runs the whole transaction.

Nesting depth is tracked per execution context via ``contextvars``, so
request handlers, the /run producer thread, and celery tasks each get an
independent depth counter.
