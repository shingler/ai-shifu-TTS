"""Validation for the origin an OAuth flow returns the browser to.

Google rejects wildcards in a client's authorized redirect URIs, so every
white-label domain would otherwise need its own entry in the Google console.
Instead all domains share one callback and the browser is sent back to the
domain it started from. That hand-back is an open redirect unless the origin is
checked against domains we actually serve, which is what this module does.
