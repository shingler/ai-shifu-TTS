"""Read-only execution engine for creator-analytics queries.

If ``ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URI`` is set, a dedicated SQLAlchemy engine is built
against the read-only replica. Otherwise the primary application engine is
reused as a development / CI fallback, with a one-shot warning so production
deployments without the replica are still observable.

Use :func:`run_query` to execute the :class:`Select` produced by
:mod:`flaskr.service.creator_analytics.sql_builder`. The function returns a
plain ``{"columns": [...], "rows": [...]}`` dict suitable for the HTTP layer.
