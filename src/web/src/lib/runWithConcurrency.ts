/**
 * Run an async `worker` over `items` with a bounded number of concurrent tasks.
 *
 * Uses a dynamic worker pool (complete one, start the next) rather than fixed
 * batches, so the pool stays saturated and there is no barrier between chunks.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 * - At most `limit` workers run at any time.
 * - Results are returned index-aligned to `items` (order preserved).
 * - A rejected worker yields `null` for that slot and never aborts the batch.
