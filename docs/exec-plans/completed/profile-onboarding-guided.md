# Profile onboarding guided questions (PR2)

## Superseded Contract Note (2026-08-25)

This plan records the backend-first rolling compatibility contract that was
required when guided onboarding first shipped. That release bridge has now
been retired by `canonical-background-onboarding-contract.md`: learner status
is a direct profile onboarding response, legacy completion and sentinel projection are
gone, and the admin API exposes only `config_revision`. The historical details
below remain accurate for the original delivery, not for the current contract.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Deliver the second learner-profile PR on `sunner/profile-onboarding-guided`. PR1 merged at `020f0392138e8c1cc9c619add1896a39b86b50fd`; the branch is synchronized with current `main` at `e65aa770ac19c611233d710d622fa58fddf8f58f`. Learners answer the teacher's MarkdownFlow questions, review the generated plain-text learner profile, and can defer only through an explicit low-emphasis action. The release preserves the established legacy onboarding protocol during backend-first rollout.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- The provided split source is not descended from the PR1 commit, so copying whole mixed files would regress PR1 and current-main work. Projection must be hunk-based except for independent additions.
- The main checkout and this worktree have identical frontend lockfiles, so its installed `node_modules` can be reused safely for local validation.

## Decision Log

- Use `331a54f531` only as implementation source, never as a wholesale tree replacement.
- Preserve the modern `service/profile/api.py`, `api/learnerProfile.ts`, and shared `ProfileDraftEditor` from PR1.
- Keep the PR2 frontend limited to guided/settings onboarding; preserve the canonical backend's dormant `pasted` completion trigger so PR3 can add import UX without another wire-contract change.
- Preserve the required fresh legacy `should_show=true` contract by projecting only the legacy top-level MarkdownFlow response; persisted/admin/current documents remain the official original.
- Treat one active Redis session per owner and purpose as a session-lifecycle invariant, not as a dedicated rate-limit or cohort subsystem.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

PR1 is merged and the complete PR2 commit series sits directly on current `main` without patch drift. Ready PR #2308 passed its full release gates and review window, then synchronized with the subsequent account-menu and profile-focus fixes from `main` without reverting either. Post-sync review hardening keeps exact official button values on the modern wire, matches the retiring parser's ECMAScript whitespace semantics on the legacy wire, prevents lossy legacy persistence, and preserves direct profile editing when optional guided services are unavailable. The delivered behavior retains the rolling dual protocol, official MarkdownFlow source, Redis isolation, PR1 learner-profile/sign-in safeguards, guided-only frontend, and the documented browser QA evidence without adding a migration.

## Context and Orientation

The legacy profile onboarding service lives at `src/api/flaskr/service/profile/onboarding.py`. New MarkdownFlow orchestration is isolated in `src/api/flaskr/service/profile_research/`. HTTP routes and admin configuration are cross-service boundaries. Frontend course gating is in `src/web/src/app/c/[[...id]]`, while reusable dialog UI belongs in `src/web/src/components/profile-onboarding`.

## Plan of Work

1. Copy only standalone source additions and compare every mixed file with PR1 before extracting behavior.
2. Introduce the current nested contract and strict complete/skip routing while keeping legacy fields and persistence separate.
3. Replace the local flow parser with MarkdownFlow rendering and a two-step guided/review dialog, then wire course and settings entry points.
4. Validate protocol isolation, runtime session behavior, frontend gates, translations, and build quality.

## Concrete Steps

1. Diff `dd715813e` and `331a54f531` file-by-file; reject source-only unrelated refactors/deletions.
2. Add `profile_research` runtime and summary prompt, route/config hooks, and focused pytest cases.
3. Apply current onboarding route/UI hunks, retaining PR1 API and direct editor code.
4. Run focused tests, format/type/lint/harness checks, then commit and publish the stacked PR.

## Validation and Acceptance

- Backend current and legacy payloads coexist and do not write each other's state.
- Guided config unavailable/broken is hidden and fail-open.
- Course dialog is guided/review only, has an explicit defer action, and does not close implicitly.
- `profile_research` has no `service.learn` import and uses shared Redis session behavior.
- Focused pytest/Jest plus type/lint and repository checks pass or have recorded environment blockers.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Changes are isolated to this branch. Re-running tests and generators is safe. If a source hunk conflicts with PR1 behavior, retain PR1 and manually apply only the current intent after inspecting call sites. No migration is generated or applied.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

- Existing legacy learner endpoints retain top-level `enabled`, `should_show`, `markdownflow`, `allowed_variable_keys`, and `current_values`.
- current is nested under `wrapped profile status` with a contract version and guided/settings actions.
- Redis sessions are scoped by owner and purpose, with one active-session pointer per scope; MarkdownFlow runtime/parser is the authoritative interaction engine.
- Deploy backend before frontend so old clients continue operating during rollout.
