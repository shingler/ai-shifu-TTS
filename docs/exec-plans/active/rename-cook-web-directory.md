# Rename The Cook Web Directory

This ExecPlan is a living document and must stay aligned with `PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Move the Next.js frontend from `src/cook-web/` to the shorter, clearer
`src/web/` path without changing product behavior or breaking repository
automation. After the migration, contributors, coding agents, CI jobs, release
workflows, Docker builds, local environments, generators, checkers, and
documentation must all resolve the current frontend through `src/web/`; only
the release workflow's bounded historical-tag lookup may read the old path.

The product and deployed container are still named Cook Web. Stable deployment
contracts such as the `ai-shifu-cook-web` image/service names and
`AI_SHIFU_COOK_WEB_IMAGE_NAME` remain unchanged unless a separate deployment
migration explicitly replaces them.

## Progress

- [x] 2026-08-30 11:42 CST: Confirmed the worktree is clean, fetched the latest
  `origin/main`, verified `HEAD` matches it, and created
  `sunner/rename-cook-web-to-web` in the current worktree.
- [x] 2026-08-30 11:42 CST: Started a full tracked-reference audit across
  frontend sources, CI, Docker, scripts, generated guidance, and documentation.
- [x] 2026-08-30 12:13 CST: Renamed the frontend directory and updated every
  live repository path contract, including the external deploy-config build
  entry point.
- [x] 2026-08-30 12:13 CST: Regenerated the collaboration and repository
  knowledge artifacts and proved a second generator run was byte-for-byte
  deterministic.
- [x] 2026-08-30 12:13 CST: Completed static, frontend, workflow, browser, and
  runtime-path validation. Docker/Compose path closure was checked statically;
  this host has no Docker-compatible CLI or daemon for a local image build.
- [x] 2026-08-30 12:13 CST: Completed the final stale-path and diff audit,
  including independent review of migration compatibility and allowlists.
- [x] 2026-08-30 13:24 CST: Verified the pull-request runtime harness with real
  Compose rendering, image builds, stack startup, endpoint readiness, and a
  Playwright smoke test; updated the path harness to tolerate ignored artifacts
  left by existing checkouts while continuing to reject tracked legacy paths.
- [x] 2026-08-30 13:35 CST: Made Codex worktree setup resolve frontend `.env`
  and `node_modules` independently, then added durable Darwin/Linux fixtures
  for current, pre-migration, upgraded, and mixed-asset source checkouts.
- [x] 2026-08-30 13:55 CST: Preserved narrowly scoped ignore rules for local
  artifacts left at the legacy path and added a harness check proving those
  artifacts stay ignored while legacy source and Yarn exception paths remain
  visible.
- [x] 2026-08-30 14:37 CST: Rebased onto `origin/main` at `c3bedc097`, moved
  the newly added profile-retention implementation into `src/web`, corrected
  its completed ExecPlan path, regenerated repository knowledge, and reran the
  repository, frontend, and production-build gates.
- [x] 2026-08-30 14:41 CST: Extended the local repository-harness hook trigger
  to cover `.gitignore`, `.codex` environment changes, and `lefthook.yml`, so
  future edits to the migration compatibility surfaces cannot skip the check.
- [x] 2026-08-30 15:19 CST: Added one zero-dependency migration helper for
  ignored frontend `.env*` files left by an in-place directory upgrade, wired
  it through development, production builds, Cursor, Codex worktrees, and the
  manual installation path, and covered its config-set semantics with focused
  regression tests and repository-harness contracts.
- [x] 2026-08-30 15:27 CST: Rebased onto `origin/main` at `011a4abc4`, proved
  all six frontend source/test blobs and the lockfile from the newly merged
  multilingual typewriter change were preserved exactly under `src/web`, then
  reinstalled the 0.2.20 dependency set and reran the full frontend and
  production-build gates.
- [x] 2026-08-31 09:55 CST: Rebased onto `origin/main` at `b7951e332`, moved
  the newly merged account-session and billing-navigation files into
  `src/web`, preserved `markdown-flow-ui` 0.2.21 and the latest generated review
  rules, corrected the account-session analytics paths, refreshed repository
  knowledge, and passed 189 frontend suites with 1,731 tests, focused backend
  session and Swagger coverage, type-checking, and the production build on
  Node 22.16.0.
- [x] 2026-08-31 10:15 CST: Rebased again after `origin/main` advanced to
  `a52171867`, moved the newly merged stale-chunk recovery component and test
  into `src/web`, proved their blobs and all five translated messages match
  main, and passed the new focused tests, type-checking, the production build,
  and all 190 frontend suites with 1,735 tests on Node 22.16.0.
- [x] 2026-08-31 10:53 CST: Rebased again after `origin/main` advanced to
  `aeef771ed`, preserved the profile-prompt-generation frontend files
  byte-for-byte under `src/web`, rebuilt the generated harness health report
  with both the active rename plan and the newly completed upstream plan, and
  passed 3 focused frontend suites with 45 tests.
- [x] 2026-09-01 13:06 CST: Retired the legacy checkout compatibility layer by removing
  the frontend environment migration helper, old-path ignore rules, and
  legacy-path Codex setup. Current checkouts now use `src/web` directly while
  the release workflow retains a bounded fallback for pre-rename tags.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: the supplied worktree began at a detached `HEAD`, but that
  commit exactly matched the freshly fetched `origin/main`.
  Evidence: both resolved to `df8ee2f4af72d3df536ae10abcadb9c54dcfb53d`.
- Observation: `src/cook-web` was embedded in generated collaboration guidance,
  path-filtered workflows, Docker build contexts, local environment setup,
  repository checkers, and long-lived documentation, so a filesystem-only move
  would cause silent CI skips and broken contributor commands.
  Evidence: the initial tracked scan found 121 files containing the exact path.
- Observation: Git can leave ignored `.env`, `node_modules`, or build output in
  `src/cook-web` after applying the tracked rename to an existing checkout.
  Evidence: the repository harness passes with an ignored legacy
  `node_modules` directory present and still rejects tracked legacy paths.
- Observation: cross-worktree setup does not protect an ordinary checkout that
  pulls the rename in place, and a missing frontend env file can silently
  change runtime behavior while missing dependencies fail visibly.
  Evidence: the active PR review reproduced the in-place gap; the canonical
  `dev` and `build` entry points now run the shared env migration helper, while
  a legacy-only `node_modules` directory produces an explicit `npm ci` hint.
- Observation: ignored artifacts such as `.next`, `.vercel`, and Playwright
  output previously inherited rules from the frontend-local `.gitignore`; once
  that tracked file moves, artifacts left in the old directory lose those
  rules and appear as untracked files.
  Evidence: root-scoped migration rules now cover the former local artifacts,
  and the harness verifies both the ignored artifacts and a visible source path.
- Observation: a nested Git fixture inherits repository-local `GIT_*`
  variables when the harness runs inside a commit hook unless they are removed
  explicitly.
  Evidence: the real pre-commit hook exposed the leak; the fixture now strips
  all inherited `GIT_*` variables and runs in an isolated temporary repository.
- Observation: GitHub CodeQL identifies alerts by path, so the directory rename
  surfaced four existing high-severity alerts as new even though the relevant
  blobs are unchanged.
  Evidence: the four branch alerts exactly match open default-branch alerts by
  rule, message, location, and source blob; the PR documents this relocation.
- Observation: a change merged into `main` after the rename added new frontend
  files and a completed ExecPlan at the legacy path.
  Evidence: after rebasing, all ten frontend files matched the new main commit
  byte-for-byte under `src/web`; the repository harness caught the one stale
  documentation path before push.

## Decision Log

- Decision: treat this as a path-contract migration, not a Cook Web product or
  container rename.
  Rationale: the requested change is the repository directory name. Renaming
  deployed images, Compose services, Nginx upstreams, secrets, or registry
  variables would create an unrelated rollout and compatibility break.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-30 / Codex
- Decision: update historical and active documentation paths mechanically when
  they point into the repository.
  Rationale: old plan history remains semantically accurate with the new path,
  while clickable commands and continuation instructions stay executable.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-30 / Codex
- Decision: rename internal technical labels and generated rule filenames when
  they encode the old directory identity, while retaining explicit Cook Web
  branding and stable deployment identifiers.
  Rationale: contributor-facing automation should match `src/web` clearly,
  but externally consumed names require backwards compatibility.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-30 / Codex
- Decision: migrate local frontend runtime env files as one configuration set
  and never migrate `node_modules` during an in-place upgrade.
  Rationale: mixing new- and old-path env files can change Next.js precedence
  without overwriting a filename, while dependencies can be recreated safely
  and should not carry stale platform-specific artifacts into the new path.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-30 / Codex
- Decision: retire the legacy checkout compatibility layer after the frontend
  directory migration while retaining the historical release-tag lookup.
  Rationale: supported checkouts now use `src/web` directly; the release
  workflow still needs one bounded fallback for tags created before the rename.
  Date/Author: 2026-09-01 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The Next.js application now lives solely under `src/web/`. GitHub Actions path
filters, cache inputs, working directories, release metadata, Docker build
contexts, local helpers, Codex actions, generators, checkers, skills, and
documentation all resolve that path. The deployment-facing Cook Web image,
service, cache-scope, and environment-variable names remain unchanged.

The release workflow reads the current MarkdownFlow UI lockfile path first and
uses one historical path fallback for release tags created before the rename.
Codex worktree setup copies environment files from the current `src/web`
checkout and reuses compatible dependencies from that same path. Legacy
checkout migration and old-path artifact compatibility are intentionally no
longer supported; users must update their checkout and install dependencies
under `src/web`. The private npm package name remains `cook-web` so the
deployment-facing package contract stays compatible.

The repository harness requires `src/web` and verifies the direct frontend
development and build entry points. It no longer maintains checks or fixtures
for legacy checkout migration and old-path artifact ignores.

The local pre-commit trigger includes the ignore rules, Codex environment
setup, manual and frontend guidance, frontend package and Codex setup inputs,
and its own lefthook configuration in addition to the existing harness
sources.

Verification passed for the full pre-commit hook suite, repository harness,
architecture fixtures and baseline, YAML/JSON syntax, embedded release Python,
translation usage, generator determinism, frontend formatting, linting, type
checking, all 187 Jest suites (1,705 tests), the optimized production build,
and the runnable browser-only Playwright case through the standard
`npm run test:e2e` entry. This host has no Docker-compatible CLI or daemon, so
the local Docker checks used static path closure. The pull-request runtime
harness subsequently passed real Compose rendering, cached image builds, full
stack startup, endpoint readiness, and the browser smoke flow against
`src/web`.

## Context and Orientation

Before this migration, `src/cook-web/` owned the Next.js application, Jest and
Playwright tests, package manifests, Dockerfiles, local frontend guidance, and
focused skills. Repository-level consumers include `.github/workflows/`, `docker/`,
`.codex/environments/`, `.cursor/`, `scripts/`, `lefthook.yml`, instruction
generators, generated knowledge indexes, and developer documentation.

The primary structural sources of truth are `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`SKILL.md`, `docs/engineering-baseline.md`, and the frontend-local guidance moved
from `src/cook-web/` to `src/web/`. Generated `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rules, GitHub
instructions, and repository inventories must be regenerated through their
own generators rather than hand-maintained independently.

## Plan of Work

1. Inventory exact-path references, lower-case technical labels, generated
   outputs, file names, and stable deployment identifiers.
2. Move the directory with Git history preservation and update all live
   repository paths from `src/cook-web` to `src/web`.
3. Rename internal path-oriented labels and files where the old directory name
   would be misleading, while preserving Cook Web branding and external
   container/image/environment contracts.
4. Update generators and checkers first, then regenerate their declared
   outputs and refresh the knowledge index.
5. Validate path filters, caches, working directories, package commands,
   Docker build contexts, Compose rendering, generated-file determinism, and
   frontend behavior.
6. Prove the old directory path is absent from tracked content and file names,
   review the full diff, and document any intentionally preserved
   `cook-web` deployment identifiers.

## Concrete Steps

- Run `git mv src/cook-web src/web`.
- Replace live repository references to `src/cook-web` with `src/web`.
- Update `.github` path filters, cache dependency paths, working directories,
  release metadata paths, and summary text that describes repository files.
- Update Docker build contexts, `COPY` paths, mounted source paths, and helper
  commands while preserving `ai-shifu-cook-web` service/image compatibility.
- Update environment setup, Cursor launchers, hooks, scripts, checkers, and
  generated guidance ownership maps.
- Regenerate AI collaboration docs and repository knowledge indexes.
- Run the acceptance commands below and record their observable results.

## Validation and Acceptance

The migration is accepted only when all of the following are true:

- `src/web/` exists and no tracked file remains under `src/cook-web/`.
- No tracked file or tracked filename contains a stale `src/cook-web` path
  outside this migration record and the bounded historical release-tag lookup.
- GitHub workflow path filters, cache inputs, working directories, release bump
  paths, and runtime artifact paths all use `src/web`.
- Repository generators run successfully and a second run is deterministic.
- `python scripts/check_dev_tools.py` reports the expected frontend tooling.
- `python scripts/check_repo_harness.py` passes.
- `python scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py --run-fixture-tests` passes.
- Frontend formatting/lint, type checking, Jest, and production build commands
  pass from `src/web`.
- Relevant workflow-script tests and translation checks pass.
- Every touched Compose file renders with `docker compose ... config`, and the
  runtime-harness build path can resolve the relocated frontend sources.
- `git diff --check` passes and the final diff contains no unrelated behavior
  changes.

## Idempotence and Recovery

The path replacement and generators must be safe to rerun. If a generator
reintroduces a removed migration-only surface, fix its source template and
regenerate instead of editing only the output. If a runtime validation fails
because local services or secrets are unavailable, preserve the repository
changes, capture the exact failure, and distinguish an environment blocker
from a path regression.

The rename is recoverable through Git because it is performed as a tracked
move on a dedicated branch. Local ignored frontend assets such as `.env`,
`node_modules`, and `.next` must remain local and must never be committed.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

- `src/web/` becomes the sole repository path for the Next.js frontend.
- GitHub Actions path filters and `working-directory` values consume
  `src/web/` directly.
- Repository Python/Node scripts consume the new path when scanning frontend
  sources or generating artifacts.
- Docker build files consume `src/web/` as their build context or `COPY`
  source, but keep the existing Cook Web image and service contracts.
- AI collaboration and skill routers point to `src/web/AGENTS.md`,
  `src/web/SKILL.md`, and their descendants.
